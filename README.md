# quartz-composer-slideshow
This sketch for [Quartz-Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer) (â‡¨ [manual](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/QuartzComposerUserGuide/qc_intro/qc_intro.html), [download info](http://artandtech.aalto.fi/?page_id=1368)) just displays Pictures from a folder. The folder is constantly monitored and the speed of the slideshow is adjustable.

I use this sketch with [Resolume](https://resolume.com) to display photos ([manual](https://resolume.com/manual/en/r5/qc)) captured with a DSLR-camera and [Hornet-C/**picture-sync**](https://github.com/Hornet-C/picture-sync).
